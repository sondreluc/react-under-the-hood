# React Under the Hood

## Why Read This Book

React is gaining a lot of attention in the JavaScript community. Today, React powers applications such as Netflix and Facebook. Combined, these two companies take up over 30% of all US internet traffic. At this point, React now powers the web, which is amazing given how recently React has been open sourced. React is now the preferred JavaScript library for building dynamic client-side web applications. It's popularity quickly surpassed that of rival projects such as Angular and Ember, forcing those projects to adopt some of the concepts React helped introduce to web development.

Its success is due to its simple API making it easy to get up and running. It's simple, easy of use, and lightning fast. In addition, it is also gaining popularity in native application development with the release of React Native.

That said, React developers rarely understand exactly how it works under the hood. In some ways, this is due to how well designed React is when compared to other projects. You don't need to understand how React works to get a non-trivial web application up and running. You can build large web applications effectively without ever having to know how React works under the hood. In contrast, Angular developers must have deep understanding Angular's internals (such as how the digest cycle works). With React, not understanding it's internals is not a show stopper.

Still, the internals of React are fascinating and worth learning. React's way of thinking is different from what we're used to in other JavaScript frameworks. React introduced ideas from gaming and early versions of Windows to the DOM, along with some of their own ideas. These concepts changed the way we think about how to build scalable and performant web applications.

## About This Book

This tutorial/free ebook is an introduction to React, but also dives much deeper into the ideas behind React. Rather than cargo-culting on what is popular, the goal is to show the reader how React works under the hood, as well as go over how to use it. In addition, we will be going over why React is great for working with existing legacy code and third-party libraries such as jQuery plugins. By the end of this book the reader should fully understand React's architectural philosophy and design decisions. The book will cover how to test and debug React applications, as well as learn React patterns and anti-patters. 

To achieve this, the book will be a mixture of explanations and a practical exercise where the reader will build a simple Star Trek video game.
